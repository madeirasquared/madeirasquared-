Shanti Mathias is a journalist, zine-maker and cyclist currently based between Ōtautahi and Tāmaki Makaurau. I've worked for The Spinoff for the last three years
where I've covered two elections and been to the Chatham Islands once. Before that I was a news and features writer at the very cool student magazine Salient. 
I have Indian and Pākeha heritage, and was lucky enough to grow up between both India and Aotearoa. My parents work has really inspired me, and I'm lucky to
have been exposed to lots of different circumstances, from small Himalayan villages to Delhi slums to the wilds of Mount Roskill to a very privileged boarding 
school. 

I have a degree in anthropology and English literature which captures lots of the work I do now: reading things, writing things, being very curious and paying 
attention to people. I still love reading and have definitely regained my love for novels after having to read many of them for my degree. These are areas of study 
I would definitely like to return to in the future!
